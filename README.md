# Programming Exercises for Python
## Data wrangling
#### 1. Create a DataFrame named df with 6 nrows with the following columns:

- A: random floating point value
- B: randomly assigned categorical values from ["test", "train"]
- C: random integer values, constructed from an numpy.array
- D: random integer values, constructed from a Series
- E: monthly dates "2021-01-01", "2021-02-01", "2021-03-01" ...
#### 2. Convert numeric columns into a numpy.matrix and compute the row sums.

#### 3. Sort df by column C.

#### 4. Filter df for entries for which B has value train and C has values greater than 0.

#### 5. Change the value in the 4th column and 2nd row to 10.

#### 6. Create a column F where half the values are NaN.

#### 7. Deal with missing values in two different ways:

- remove entries with missing data
- fill missing values with 0
#### 8. Convert column A into a cumulative sum.

#### 9. Subtract column A from column B.

#### 10. Plot the numeric columns as a line plot, ensuring that the plot has proper labels.

#### 11. Compute the mean values of each column for groups train and test.

#### 12. Convert the following DataFrame from a into b (long to wide). Additionally, convert from b into a (wide to long).

```
a = pd.DataFrame(
    {"value": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "group": ["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b"]}
)

b = pd.DataFrame(
    {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5, 6]}
)
```

## Supervised learning
#### 1. Load the iris dataset by
```
import sklearn as sk
import sklearn.datasets
iris = sk.datasets.load_iris()
```
#### 2. Visualize the data matrix.

#### 3. Train a random forest classifier to predict the target values and report its performance using an appropriate evaluation metric.

#### 4. Explain how key parameters of the random forest classifier would influence its peformance.

## Text mining
#### 1. Using Biopython, collect medline abstracts on "medulloblastoma" published in 2012. Save the data to disk as a CSV table.

#### 2. Import the CSV table and build a SQLite database.

## Neural network
#### 1. Implement a full connected feedforward network from scratch using only the numpy library with the following layers: one input, two hidden, and one output. Neurons in the first hidden layer should use the sigmoid transfer function; those in the second hidden layer should use a ReLU transfer function. The network should be trained using backpropagation of errors.
